# FlowDoc vNext Core

This is the extracted core package for the FlowDoc vNext document model. It owns the canonical package schema, relationship graph, operations, measured pagination, renderer-consumption contract, and read-only bridge runtime.

## Boundary

- This package must not import current editor runtime code.
- Current/prototype code is reference evidence only. It must not enter the
  exported vNext source path as an accepted input model.
- Tests must run from this package without depending on the app runtime.
- Fixtures in this folder should use vNext shape and sanitized data.
- Package envelope compatibility stays explicit: the canonical vNext persisted
  input is package v2 containing document v3.
- Old document versions and prototype node names are rejected by the canonical
  vNext parser. Any future one-off conversion tool must live outside exported
  core and outside required vNext checks.

## Local Commands

From this package after dependencies are available:

```sh
npm run type-check
npm run test
npm run check
```

From the current parent repository without installing this folder separately:

```sh
../node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json
../node_modules/.bin/vitest run --config vitest.config.ts
```

## Current Slice

- Document schema version: `3`
- Package envelope target: `FlowDocPackage.packageVersion = 2`
- Implemented baseline nodes: `zone`, `text-block`, `columns`, `column`,
  `table`, `table-row`, `table-cell`, `toc`, `page-break`, `divider`,
  `spacer`
- Implemented graph baseline: parent refs, child indexes, nearest context,
  capabilities, and relationship diagnostics
- Product-shaped fixture: `fixtures/product-report-vnext.flowdoc.json`
- Canonical package boundary: parse, safe-parse, and serialize package v2 with
  document v3
- Operation baseline: graph-backed `node.delete`, `node.duplicate`,
  `node.reorder`, `columns.insert`, `columns.layout.patch`,
  `text-block.insert`, `text-block.text.replace`, `table.row.insert`, and
  `table.row.delete`, `table.column.insert`, and `table.column.delete`
  commands with validation, history policy, render invalidation, and scope
  metadata
- Durable history-ready operation record helper for committed and rejected
  operation results, plus append/replay helpers for operation history records
- Pagination/export planning boundary: page boxes, source item order,
  renderer contract, and operation invalidation from canonical vNext documents
- Measured pagination skeleton: page fragments, forced page breaks, text-block
  line fragmentation, static header/footer fragments, and page-number inline
  resolution from canonical vNext documents
- Text measurement contract: stable cache keys, line boxes, reusable
  measurement cache, operation invalidation, and pagination fragment metadata
- Columns pagination skeleton: `widthShare`/gap-based column geometry with
  measured child fragments and column metadata
- Table pagination skeleton: row-level page breaks, repeated header row
  fragments, cell geometry, measured cell text metadata, and over-tall
  breakable text-cell row splits
- Table cell block policy: measured text, atomic spacer/divider, generated TOC,
  and ignored page-break behavior is explicit in fragment metadata/warnings
- Export readiness gate: measured pagination reports ready, ready-with-warnings,
  or blocked without letting renderers relayout; renderer-consumption audit
  blocks export when measured fragments lack geometry or table metadata needed
  by a fragment-only renderer
- Table direction plan: `docs/TABLE_PAGINATION_VNEXT_PLAN.md` selects
  row-level pagination plus splittable cell text before the deferred full table
  engine path
- Phase 10 close audit: `docs/PHASE_10_CLOSE_AUDIT.md` marks the vNext core
  pagination/export boundary complete for bridge work while deferring concrete
  PDF/DOCX renderers and product smokes
- Phase 12 extraction checklist:
  `docs/PHASE_12_REPOSITORY_EXTRACTION_CHECKLIST.md` defines the files to move,
  the parent consumers to keep out of the new core repository, and the
  verification gates required before the physical split
- Extraction boundary tests:
  `tests/extractionBoundary.test.ts` verify standalone required files and guard
  `src/**` against parent app/current core imports before the physical split
- Phase 11 bridge plan: `../docs/EDITOR_VNEXT_RUNTIME_BRIDGE_PLAN.md` starts
  the editor bridge lane with a read-only vNext bridge runtime target before
  parent editor runtime integration
- Phase 11 import boundary: `../docs/EDITOR_VNEXT_IMPORT_BOUNDARY_DECISION.md`
  keeps this folder in-repo for now and allows parent editor imports only
  through the parent bridge host
- Parent editor bridge host:
  `../src/app/editor/_components/vnextBridge/editorVNextBridgeHost.ts` consumes
  the vNext public entrypoint and returns bounded read-only readiness snapshots
- Read-only editor bridge runtime: `src/editorBridge/runtime.ts` composes
  canonical package parsing, relationship graph, measured pagination,
  renderer-consumption audit, export readiness, and supported operation kinds
  without accepting current runtime document input
- Editor/generation boundary map:
  `../docs/EDITOR_GENERATION_BOUNDARY_MAP.md` separates editor-authored
  template truth, generation request data, bound runtime views, measured
  pagination, renderer-consumption, and preview/export artifacts
- Parent read-only generation diagnostic:
  `../src/app/editor/_components/vnextBridge/editorGenerationReadiness.ts`
  consumes the parent bridge host and reports generation readiness without
  consuming request data, rendering artifacts, replacing API routes, or
  mutating editor state
- Parent operation pilot:
  `runEditorVNextTextReplaceOperationPilot(...)` in
  `../src/app/editor/_components/vnextBridge/editorVNextBridgeHost.ts` runs one
  canonical vNext `text-block.text.replace` operation and returns validation,
  history-ready, scope, and render-invalidation metadata without applying it to
  current editor state or exposing a full mutated document
- Runtime flip review gate:
  `../docs/EDITOR_VNEXT_RUNTIME_FLIP_REVIEW_GATE.md` passes Phase 11 bridge
  readiness and blocks visible editor runtime flip until a separate plan
  resolves current reducer state, history, canvas, selection, WYSIWYG,
  pagination, and export/API dependencies
- Parent vNext generation API routes:
  `../src/app/api/vnext/generation/readiness/route.ts`,
  `../src/app/api/vnext/generation/preview/route.ts`, and
  `../src/app/api/vnext/generation/preview/svg/route.ts` expose readiness,
  measured preview artifact commands, and bounded SVG preview artifacts from
  canonical package input without replacing current `/api/paginate`,
  `/api/export`, editor state, history, selection, or canvas behavior

Not implemented yet:

- editor runtime integration;
- replacement for current `/api/paginate` and `/api/export`;
- form-slot or submission-state runtime;
- renderer-backed text measurement profile implementation, non-text table-cell
  content splitting, multi-page column balancing, and final
  pagination-aware TOC page resolution;
- PDF/DOCX renderer implementation beyond the measured-fragment consumption
  contract;
- durable operation history persistence outside the in-memory replay helper;
- product-level editor acceptance smokes.
