## Current Rule

This repository should prefer isolated vNext implementation over reuse.
Current/prototype structures are reference evidence only and are not accepted
inputs for exported core. The canonical persisted input is
`FlowDocPackage.packageVersion = 2` with `document.version = 3`. Any future
one-off converter must live outside exported core and outside required vNext
checks.

## Phase 12 Extraction Record

Phase 12 is complete for physical repository extraction. This repository has
standalone package files, local type-check/test scripts, canonical vNext
fixtures, parser/serializer tests, and boundary tests proving `src/**` does not
import parent app or current core paths.

Parent app consumers remain outside the extracted core. They should consume the
package through an explicit parent bridge/dependency boundary.

## Phase 10 Close

Phase 10 is closed for the vNext core pagination/export boundary. The close
audit is `docs/PHASE_10_CLOSE_AUDIT.md`. Current pagination/export work is
vNext-only and now has both a planning boundary and measured skeleton output:

- `buildVNextPaginationPlan(...)` produces page boxes, zone source order,
  source item split-policy hints, and measurement status.
- `paginateVNextDocument(...)` consumes the vNext plan and emits measured page
  fragments for body/static zones, forced page breaks, text-block line
  fragmentation, and basic page-number inline resolution.
- `measureVNextText(...)` defines the vNext text measurement boundary with
  stable cache keys, line boxes, measurement profiles, cache hit/miss metadata,
  and operation-driven cache invalidation.
- `columns` nodes now produce `widthShare`/gap-based container and child
  fragments instead of one opaque atomic fragment.
- `table` nodes now produce page-segment, row, cell, and measured text
  fragments with row-level page breaks and repeated header rows.
- over-tall breakable table rows whose cell children are text blocks now split
  by measured line ranges while `allowBreak=false` rows stay atomic and warn.
- table cell child policy is explicit for measured text, atomic spacer/divider,
  generated TOC, and ignored page-break nodes.
- `buildVNextMeasuredRendererConsumption(...)` converts measured fragments into
  renderer commands without accepting authored document input, and blocks when
  table fragments lack geometry, hierarchy, line-range, or table metadata.
- `assessVNextMeasuredPaginationExportReadiness(...)` reports ready,
  ready-with-warnings, or blocked from measured pagination warnings and
  renderer-consumption issues while preserving the no-relayout renderer
  contract.
- `docs/TABLE_PAGINATION_VNEXT_PLAN.md` locks the selected table direction as
  row-level pagination plus splittable cell text, with full table-engine work
  deferred until the B path is stable.
- `createApproximateVNextTextMeasurer(...)` provides deterministic measurement
  for tests and early local integration without importing the parent runtime.
- `buildVNextExportPlan(...)` declares that PDF and DOCX consume measured
  pagination output and must not relayout.
- `resolveVNextPaginationInvalidation(...)` maps operation results to stale or
  unchanged pagination/export readiness.

This phase intentionally does not import the parent layout engine, provide a
renderer-backed measurement profile implementation, split non-text table cell
content across pages, balance columns across multiple pages, finalize TOC page
references, or render PDF/DOCX beyond the measured-fragment consumption
contract.

## Phase 16 Layout Pipeline Split

Phase 16 adds the first vNext-native staged layout pipeline contract over the
existing measured pagination engine:

- `createVNextLayoutPipelinePlan(...)` turns pagination source items into
  deterministic layout jobs and measurement jobs.
- `runVNextLayoutPipelineChunk(...)` provides cursor-based measurement-job
  scheduling and bounded measured page/render-command artifact chunks.
- `runVNextLayoutPipeline(...)` returns the complete measured pagination,
  renderer-consumption, and export-readiness artifacts through one layout
  pipeline API.
- artifact chunks preserve the no-relayout renderer contract and include only
  commands for the bounded page range.
- `tests/layoutPipeline.test.ts` proves stage order, measurement-job
  chunk/resume, artifact page chunking, render-command bounds, and source
  independence.

This phase intentionally keeps `paginateVNextDocument(...)` as the placement
engine. Moving actual text/table placement behind resumable job results remains
a later internal split after the public pipeline contract is stable.

## Phase 17 Layout Internal Extraction Baseline

Phase 17 starts splitting measured pagination internals without changing text,
table, renderer, or export behavior:

- `measuredTypes.ts` owns measured pagination options, warnings, fragments,
  pages, and pagination result contracts.
- `measuredFragments.ts` owns measured page creation, source-item backed
  fragment creation, geometry rounding, body/static fragment id buckets, and
  missing-source warnings.
- `paginateVNextDocument(...)` now uses the measured fragment builder while
  remaining the behavior-preserving placement engine.
- renderer/export/layout pipeline and editor bridge consumers import measured
  contracts from `measuredTypes.ts` instead of the placement engine.
- `tests/measuredFragments.test.ts` proves fragment builder behavior directly.

This phase intentionally does not change wrap quality, line breaking, table
splitting, or measurement profile behavior. The next layout-internal target is
text-block line-slice planning, then wrap quality improvements.

## Phase 11 Parent Bridge Boundary

Phase 11 connected the old/current editor environment to vNext through an
explicit bridge without making legacy/current runtime structures the vNext
source of truth. Parent adapter docs and routes are external consumer evidence,
not core ownership.

Current Phase 11 progress:

- `createVNextEditorBridgeRuntime(...)` and
  `safeCreateVNextEditorBridgeRuntime(...)` build a read-only bridge runtime
  from canonical vNext package input only.
- The bridge runtime includes relationship graph, measured pagination,
  renderer-consumption audit, export readiness, and supported operation kinds.
- Raw/current runtime document input is rejected by the bridge parser.
- Import boundary is locked: parent editor imports should go through its bridge
  host and package dependency, not through vNext internals.
- Parent editor bridge host is implemented as a read-only bounded snapshot API.
- Editor/generation boundary mapping stays in the parent consumer repository:
  editor-authored template truth, generation request truth, bound runtime view,
  measured pagination, renderer-consumption, and output artifacts are separate.
- Current `/api/paginate` and `/api/export` remain current-runtime-shaped
  endpoints; the vNext bridge remains canonical-package-only.
- First read-only generation diagnostic consumer is implemented in the parent
  app. It calls the bridge host, records request data as not consumed, and
  reports no editor state/history/selection/pagination/canvas/API side effects.
- First mutating operation pilot is implemented through the parent bridge host.
  It runs `text-block.text.replace`, returns validation/history-ready/scope and
  render-invalidation metadata, and reports no current editor state/history/
  selection/pagination/canvas/API side effects.
- Runtime flip review remains a parent consumer concern. The extracted core
  exposes canonical package/runtime behavior but does not mutate parent editor
  state, history, canvas, selection, WYSIWYG, pagination, or export/API paths.
- Post-Phase-11 generation artifact lanes expose parent-app readiness,
  measured preview artifact, and bounded SVG preview artifact routes without
  replacing current `/api/paginate`, current `/api/export`, editor state,
  history, selection, or canvas behavior.

## Phase 9 Baseline

Current operation commands are graph-backed and canonical-only:

- `node.delete`
- `node.duplicate`
- `node.reorder`
- `columns.insert`
- `columns.layout.patch`
- `text-block.insert`
- `text-block.text.replace`
- `table.row.insert`
- `table.row.delete`
- `table.column.insert`
- `table.column.delete`

They return validation policy, history policy, render invalidation, and graph
scope metadata. `createVNextOperationHistoryRecord(...)` converts committed and
rejected operation results into JSON-serializable history-ready records.
`appendVNextOperationHistoryRecord(...)` and
`replayVNextOperationHistory(...)` provide an in-memory replay contract. This
does not persist durable operation history or integrate with the current editor
runtime yet.
